# BasicallyCreate

A Minecraft 1.19 Forge Modpack that includes [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and not much else.

I wanted to play with Create in a vanilla environment, and added some informational and performance mods.

## Included Mods

This pack includes these mods:

* [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) by [simibubi](https://www.curseforge.com/members/simibubi)
* [Just Enough Items (JEI)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) by [mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/members/mezz)
