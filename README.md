# BasicallyCreate

A Minecraft 1.19 Forge Modpack that includes [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and not much else.

I wanted to play with Create in a mostly vanilla environment, and added some informational and performance mods. To keep the terrain interesting without adding new blocks, I also added Terralith.
